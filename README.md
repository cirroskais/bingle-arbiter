# bingle-arbiter

The Bingle arbiter is designed to be used with almost any revival backend.

It comes preloaded with some Lua scripts made by kinery and jackd900.

You **will** have to replace/modify these scripts when implementing for your own projects.

Set your desired settings in `.env.example`, then rename it to `.env`.
